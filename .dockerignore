# This cute two-liner works around an issue with CDK's `.dockerignore` parsing.
# If we don't explicitly include `packages`, subdirectories will be excluded
# even if they are explicitly included. ðŸ¤¦ However, we don't want *all*
# subdirectories, so the second line proceeds to ignore all of them. We can then
# proceed normally, explicitly including the things we need.
