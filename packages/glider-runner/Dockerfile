# Prisma binaries doesn't run on Alpine on ARM yet, so we use Debian instead. We
# specify `bullseye` to avoid problems observed with the default `16` which uses
# `buster`. On Docker for Mac, `buster` occasionally takes 5s to resolve
# `host.docker.internal`, leading to Prisma connection timeouts.
#
# See related issue in Docker for Mac's GitHub repo:
# https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5548#issuecomment-1029204019
#
# NOTE(ptr): Node 18 uses `bullseye` by default, so we can remove the OS version
# spec when we upgrade.
#
# TODO(ptr): don't forget to update the base image in the binary-fetching script
# in @balsa/glider-plugin when you switch back to Alpine!
